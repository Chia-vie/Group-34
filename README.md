# Group-34
Group-34 project for codeastro workshop

## Project Goals for Day 1:
Project Goal: You should decide on an idea for a final project and start structuring/writing the code
Come up with an idea for a small Python package to work on for the week. The function can be simple (for example: a package to blur images). The goal for the package is to learn the steps to develop and publish this package.
Start working on writing/designing the code. Think about how to structure your code: what should be a function, and what should be a class?

## Project Tasks for Day 2:
Set up a Github repository for your project. Start creating modules and classes that you need.
Write at least 1 or 2 functions for tomorrow (we'll need it for an activity).
The next two days will have a lot of scaffolding work for your code packages. Today is a good time to make progress on code functionality!

## Project ideas

1) Tool for creating mock IFU (galaxy) spectra 

### 2) Easy solution for integrating sliders in plots, with large datasets, + save button, Plotting, rcParams-Vorlage? Make a GUI?
    
3) Data handling  

## Things to consider:

Need multiple functions, how to structure that?
What to use for GUI? Possible tools:
    Tkinter, PyQt, Plotly, PySimpleGUI

Object contains data, 
functions plot/ do stuff with data

How to test?
